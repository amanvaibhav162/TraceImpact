## 📖 Overview
**TraceImpact** is a decentralized application (dApp) that ensures every donation is traceable, verifiable, and fully transparent. We solve the "black box" problem in traditional charity by linking on-chain financial transactions directly to tamper-proof spending proofs (receipts) stored on IPFS.

### 🛡️ The Problem
* **Visibility**: Donors lose track of funds after they are sent.
* **Verification**: NGOs lack a verifiable way to prove fund utilization in real-time.
* **Trust**: Mismanagement risks reduce overall donation volumes.

### 💡 The Solution
* **Unique ID**: Every donation is logged immutably on the Polygon blockchain.
* **Proof-to-Chain**: NGOs must upload a bill/receipt to IPFS to receive fund releases.
* **End-to-End Tracking**: Public verification links for every expenditure entry.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* 💎 **Full Transparency**: Every usage record is publicly verifiable.
* 📦 **IPFS Storage**: Receipts are stored with permanent public links via Pinata.
* 🏆 **Gamified Leaderboard**: Ranks donors based on frequency and volume to boost engagement.
* 📍 **Impact Maps**: Mapbox integration for geographical visualization of social good.
* 🔔 **Real-Time Alerts**: SMS notifications via Twilio when your donation is put to work.
